How to delete a non-empty directory in Terminal?

Tried:
rmdir foldername

This error comes up:
rmdir: failed to remove `lampp': Directory not empty

Solution:
rm -rf foldername
It deletes all files and folders contained in the lampp directory.

Note: letters -f, -r, -v:
    -f = to ignore non-existent files, never prompt
    -r = to remove directories and their contents recursively
    -v = to explain what is being done
